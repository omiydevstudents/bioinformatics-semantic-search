Its primary goal is to reduce variability introduced by differences in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and imaging centers. The tool is based on the ComBat methodology, which uses an empirical Bayes linear model to correct batch effects by estimating location and scale parameters. It offers two harmonization strategies: the ComBat method, which aligns radiomic features to a common scale based on either all centers (ComBat) or a user-defined batch grouping (M-ComBat), and the Nested ComBat method, which enables simultaneous correction for multiple batch effects in hierarchical settings. This tool is intended to improve the robustness and comparability of radiomic features in multi-center studies.",

Unlike many machine-learning approaches (e.g., AlphaFold2, TrRosetta, RaptorX), it integrates the Debye-Hückel formalism for charged side-chain interactions with a Mie potential for intramolecular forces. Based on a coarse-grained representation, PEP-FOLD4 performs competitively on well-structured peptides and shows significant improvements for poly-charged peptides, making it particularly useful for studying pH- and salt-dependent conformations.",

RelocaTE2 uses the reads associated with TEs as seeds to cluster the read pairs on chromosomes. It automatically detects the target site duplication (TSD) of a TE insertion from alignments in each cluster, which enable high resolution mapping of TE polymorphisms. Unlike parallel searching of multi-TE elements in RelocaTE, RelocaTE2 searches all TEs in one cycle, which enables us find polymorphisms of thousands of TEs in an individual genome or large population in a reasonable timeframe without losing sensitivity and specificity",

However, integrating such a large amount of population data is still a challenging task. To address this, we developed an interpretable machine learning model, ECMarker, to predict gene expression biomarkers and regulatory networks specific for disease stages such as early cancer.

Weighted quality evaluation of assembled microbial genomes | SUMMARY:Metagenomics and single-cell genomics have revolutionized the study of microorganisms, increasing our knowledge of microbial genomic diversity by orders of magnitude. A major issue pertaining to metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) is to estimate their completeness and redundancy. Most approaches rely on counting conserved gene markers. In miComplete, we introduce a weighting strategy, where we normalize the presence absence of markers by their median distance to the next marker in a set of complete reference genomes. This approach alleviates biases introduced by the presence absence of shorter DNA pieces containing many markers, e.g. ribosomal protein operons.

We demonstrate that our approach identifies not only previously detected CRISPR arrays, but also CRISPR array candidates not detected by other tools. Compared to other methods, our tool has a drastically reduced false positive rate.

At the end of each iteration, those probabilities are used to re-calculate (correct) a consensus sequence for each reference SSU sequence, and the mapping is\nrepeated, followed by the estimations of probabilities. The iterations should usually stop when the reference sequences no longer change from one iteration to the next.  Practically, 40-80 iterations is usually sufficient for many samples.

Comparing the composition of samples (functionally/taxonomically), either from a longitudinal study or cross-sectional studies can provide clues into how the microbiota has adapted to the environment. However, a recurring challenge is that key metadata about the sample and molecular methods used to extract and sequence the genetic material are often missing from sequence records, making it difficult to account for confounding factors. Nevertheless, this missing metadata may be found in the narrative of publications describing the research. This respository offers a new metagenomics annotations pipeline that regularly enrich up-to-date ENA and MGnify metagenomics studies with metadata extracted from research articles in EuropePMC. These metadata are now available for researchers to explore and retrieve in the MGnify and Europe PMC websites, and Europe PMC annotations API.",

    "text": "rawMSA. End-to-end Deep Learning using raw Multiple Sequence Alignments | In the last decades, huge efforts have been made in the bioinformatics community to develop machine learning-based methods for the prediction of structural features of proteins in the hope of answering fundamental questions about the way proteins function and their involvement in several illnesses. The recent advent of Deep Learning has renewed the interest in neural networks, with dozens of methods being developed taking advantage of these new architectures. However, most methods are still heavily based pre-processing of the input data, as well as extraction and integration of multiple hand-picked, and manually designed features. Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) are the most common source of information in de novo prediction methods. Deep Networks that automatically refine the MSA and extract useful features from it would be immensely powerful",

It generalizes well to new species and is robust to limitations in training data size. Its design reflects the intuition that for two proteins to physically interact, a subset of amino acids from each protein should be in con-tact with the other. The intermediate stages of D-SCRIPT directly implement this intuition, with the penultimate stage in D-SCRIPT being a rough estimate of the inter-protein contact map of the protein dimer. This structurally-motivated design enhances the interpretability of the results and, since structure is more conserved evolutionarily than sequence, improves generalizability across species.",

SpCLUST extends a previously released software by integrating additional scoring matrices which enables it to cover the clustering of amino-acid sequences. The similarity matrix is now computed in parallel according to the master slave distributed architecture, using MPI. Performance analysis, realized on two real datasets of 100 nucleotide sequences and 1049 amino-acids ones, show that the resulting library substantially outperforms the original Python package. The proposed package was also intensively evaluated on simulated and real genomic and protein data sets. The clustering results were compared to the most known traditional tools, such as UCLUST, CD-HIT and DNACLUST",

DEAP performance was illustrated on two different gene and protein expression studies.

Parallelised Computing for Big Linear Mixed Models.\n\nWithin neuroimaging large-scale, shared datasets are becoming increasingly commonplace, challenging existing tools both in terms of overall scale and complexity of the study designs. As sample sizes grow, researchers are presented with new opportunities to detect and account for grouping factors and covariance structure present in large experimental designs. In particular, standard linear model methods cannot account for the covariance and grouping structures present in large datasets, and the existing linear mixed models (LMM) tools are neither scalable nor exploit the computational speed-ups afforded by vectorisation of computations over voxels. Further, nearly all existing tools for imaging (fixed or mixed effect) do not account for variability in the patterns of missing data near cortical boundaries and the edge of the brain, and instead omit any voxels with any missing data",

Originally developed by Galaxy Europe and the Gallantries project, together with the Galaxy community we have created \"Training Infrastructure-as-a-Service\" (TIaaS), aimed at providing user-friendly training infrastructure to the global training community. TIaaS provides dedicated training resources for Galaxy-based courses and events. Event organisers register their course, after which trainees are transparently placed in a private queue on the compute infrastructure, which ensures jobs complete quickly, even when the main queue is experiencing high wait times. A built-in dashboard allows instructors to monitor student progress.\n\nTraining Infrastructure as a Service (TIaaS) has been in development since 21 June 2018, and three days later became a production service at Galaxy Europe on 24 June. As of June 7th, 2023 is has supported 504 training events with over 24000 learners have used this infrastructure for Galaxy training.",

It can predict an organism's uptake and secretion capabilities without requiring gap-filling, although gap-filling is also supported. Additionally, CarveMe allows the generation of microbial community models by merging single species models. The tool offers advanced features such as manual adjustment of blasting options, an orthology-based search using eggNOG-mapper (kegg-bigg branch), the ability to provide a custom media library for gap-filling, and the generation of models compatible with various SBML formats. Furthermore, CarveMe supports ensemble modeling, which helps explore how different alternative solutions can lead to diverse network structures and predict various phenotypes. During the model carving process, users can select from provided templates or create their own customized universe model to suit their specific needs.",
